# mosfez-xen-types

Basic xen number types for microtonal scale representation and manipulation with TypeScript / JavaScript.

## Development

You will need `node@16` or greater and `yarn@1` installed globally. Clone the repo and run `yarn prep`.

Then you can run:

- `yarn build` to build the `*.ts` source files into `*.js` files and `*.d.ts` type files in `/dist`.
- `yarn test` to run tests using `jest`.
- `yarn pretty` to run the auto-formatter `prettier`.
- `yarn lint` to run the linter `eslint`.
